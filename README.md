> [!TIP]
> Turn a fresh Void Linux installation

> [!CAUTION]
> into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern system

> [!NOTE]
> based on Hyprland by running a single command.

### To start enter following command on a new bare Void Linux installation within your new user shell:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gAlleb/omvoid/refs/heads/main/boot.sh | bash
```
> [!WARNING]  
> Script will ask you for password a few times.
> There is a known issue when accepting Hyprland repo key - just rerun `bash ~/.local/share/omvoid/install.sh` and you are good to go.

Project started as a private repo just to reproduce my setup across different machines. But hey, sharing is caring :) Got some ideas from Omarchy project and Jake@Linux, reorganized initial scripting, tweaked some stuff. Work in progress.

### And, of course, themes :D However built-in `ALT+W` script will give you endless themes based on the selected wallpaper.
